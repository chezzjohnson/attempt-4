Change 'General Notes' name to 'General Trip Notes'

think of genreal trip notes as attached to trip and intentions as attached to intentions

    Create reports system(post, 7, 14, 30) + intergate with notes 
        - There will be a report system that prompts thse user to follow up on their intentions/trip.
            - the general notes are for the trip as a whole, and the intention notes are for the specific intention.
            - the user can add notes during the post trip report (general + intentions)-
            - the user can add notes during the 7, 14, 30 days post trip report (general + intentions)
            - These post trip reports/follow up reports - for intentions and the trip 

        - option to add notes during post trip report (general + intentions)-


This format of post trip reports follows the same for both intentions and general trip notes (12 hr, non editable after)

    report system 
    - score and note optionality, 
        - are you sure you do not want to make a note? (if no note created)
    these notes are editable only for the next 12 hours, and then they are locked and assigned to their assigned post trip/follow up report
        - make it obvious that they are uneditable and thererfore special, this is imoportant because those reports are special looking from the typical notes 
            - blue progression for the report notes (light to dark)
                - highlight the report notes with aapsiceal highlight
            - green progression for the normal notes (light to dark)

    When the general post trip report is not reported, write that out (in different letter color + italicizied ) only if it is past due and the user hsa chosen not to write one
        - the user should be proompted with the exisitng rate now button for the follow up/post trip rports that they do not rate, expiring in 12 hours (alsdo the editable time of that note)
        
            Create a better visual timeline on the history screen for both types of notes (more than the simple orrder as of now)
            - add a minimal timeline aspect that looks sleek and modern beut maintains functionality. 
            postrtrip/follow up report notes highlighteed in the color of their tag (blue or green)

    discerns between notes and report notes. 
        - report notes only able to be created through the post trip/follow up report screen, 
        - normal notes have normal functionality 
    

    'during trip' notes are locked
    'post trip' notes are locked after 12 hours 
    the same goes for the 7, 14, 30 days post trip notes 
    otherwise notes have 'x' days after (1 day - not 1 days)


    follow up reports should mimic the post trip reports
    all reports have the general trip notes and intention notes, two seperate screens (can go back and forth between them)


    Further integration later:
    need to make the follow up reports section on home screen with upcoming follow up reports
    header howing all upcoming follow urportsordered by date categor y
    need to make intentions have notifications for the follow up reports

    // Intentions Tab //
    Will need to add a section on the intentions tab showing the notes/ratings needed 
    Another card on intentions showing the percentage of ratings and the percentgage of notes created for each post-trip/follow up report (completion rate) - stat for general + intention notes seperately and then an average of both + ONE FOR RATINGS of intentions


    Data Model Updates
* Important note: the current data model has the tafg post-trip report assigned to ntoes takaen within 24 hours after the trip' this must change obviously to fit this new logic
* tags must be clearly defined and anchored, seperating from 'days after' note tags (this is important for the history screen

[ ] Add reportType (or tag) property to Note objects
Values: 'post-trip', '7d', '14d', '30d', or null (for normal notes)
Applies to both intention notes and general trip notes
[ ] Ensure all report notes (created via post-trip/follow-up reports) are assigned the correct reportType
[ ] Normal notes (not tied to a report) should have reportType: null or omit the property
2. Tag Color Mapping
[ ] Define a color mapping for each report type/tag
Example:
Apply to ReportSystem...
;
3. Note Creation & Locking Logic
[ ] Update note creation for reports:
When a note is created via a post-trip or follow-up report, set its reportType accordingly.
Set a timestamp for when the note was created.
[ ] Locking rules:
Report notes: Editable for 12 hours after creation, then locked.
"During trip" notes: Always locked.
Normal notes: Editable as usual.
4. Ratings Logic
[ ] Ensure only intention notes (not general trip notes) can be rated
[ ] General trip notes should never display or store a rating
5. Timeline/History UI
[ ] Redesign the timeline/history screen:
Visually separate report notes and normal notes.
For report notes, display the tag (e.g., "Post-Trip", "7d") and use the tagâ€™s color as a highlight/accent.
For normal notes, use a default/neutral color and no report tag.
Clearly show locked/unlocked state for each note.
[ ] Display overdue report prompts/messages:
If a report is overdue and not completed, show a message in a distinct style (different color, italicized).
6. User Prompts & Flows
[ ] Prompt the user if they skip making a note during a report:
"Are you sure you do not want to make a note?" (score and note are both optional)
[ ] Show the "Rate Now or Write Note Now" button for overdue post-trip/follow-up report ratings ('Rate Now'for intentions) or ('write note now' for general trip notes/intention notes), expiring in 12 hours (matching the editable window for the note) on the husotry screen
7. Home Screen Integration
[ ] Add a section to the home screen for upcoming follow-up reports:
Ordered by date and category
Header showing all upcoming follow-up reports
[ ] Add notification system for intentions with upcoming reports
8. Follow-Up Reports Structure
[ ] Ensure follow-up reports (7, 14, 30 days) mimic the post-trip report structure:
Each report includes both general trip notes and intention notes
Two separate screens, with navigation between them
9. Visual Consistency
[ ] Ensure all report notes (intention and general) use the tag color for their highlight/accent
[ ] Ensure all normal notes use a neutral/default color
[ ] Ensure all tags and colors are consistent across all screens and note types
10. Testing & Polish
[ ] Test all flows:
Note creation, editing, locking, overdue prompts, and timeline display
Color progression and tag display for all note types
Ratings only on intention notes
[ ] Polish UI for clarity and modern appearance
